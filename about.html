<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Abdelrahman Ahmed, I am a formal veternary medicine student and now i am learning programin to change my career.
  It is important for me to learn deffernt skills, and of course coding is a crucial skill.
  Also i am planning to learn graphic design, and how to use photoshop; becouse it is a nessecity for freelancers.
  also i do think that the more skills you accouire the more valable you become.
  Remember this The more skills you acouir the more valiable you become.</p>
